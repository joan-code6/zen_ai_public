# done:
 Fix in /web-app/ that when you are in a new chat state and you click the send button it should not just create a new chat but also send the message that is in the input box into that new chat and the UI should change to show the sended message by the user.

# To do:

Implement that instead of using the real openrouter servers add a config that you can switch to a different server url and different set of api keys.

Implement that in the config you can set multiple models to choose from and the user gets the option to select which model to use.
